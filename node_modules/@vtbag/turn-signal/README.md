## !!! News !!!

The Turn-Signal learned a new trick! With the new `link-types` script, you can assign view transition types directly to the links that trigger navigation. This means you can create different view transition animations for the same page, based on the link that takes you there! Simply use `data-vtbag-link-types` attributes to set transition types and use them in your CSS to guard your animation rules.

But that's not all: `link-types` lets you specify different transition types for history back navigation, too!

Check out the [image viewer tech demo](https://vtbag.dev/viewer-demo/) for a hands-on example and the docs at [vtbag.dev/tools/turn-signal](https://vtbag.dev/tools/turn-signal/#link-types).

Happy animating! üéâ

### What happened before?

> Transition types and direction attributes are now also determined on the old page!

## What is it?

Turn-Signal is a lightweight script that enhances *browser-native* *cross-document* **view transitions** by detecting the **direction** of browser **navigation**. It enables developers to create smooth, responsive transitions that adjust based on forward or backward navigation, delivering a more intuitive user experience.

When your pages slide to the left on forward navigation, let them slide to the right when the users goes back in the browser's history.

The script automatically detects the traversal direction and sets `backward`, `same` or `forward` view transition types accordingly. You can also instruct the script to set data attributes on the `<html>` element.

If your site has the concept of a _previous_ and _next_ page, the Turn-Signal can automatically generate directional transitions for you.
