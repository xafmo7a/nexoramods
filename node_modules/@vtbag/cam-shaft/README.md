## !!! News !!!

The Cam-Shaft should now also work for browsers that support cross-document view transitions but have no support for the Navigation API (looking at you, Safari).

For details see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vtbag/cam-shaft/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


## What is it?

When you assign a `view-transition-name` to an element that is larger than the viewport, the View Transition API adds a default animation to the `::view-transition-group()` of the element that makes instant scrolling look like smooth scrolling. The Cam-Shaft bumps and nudges your view transition pseudo-elements back into place to avoid that pseudo-smooth-scrolling effect.
